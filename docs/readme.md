## Docs for `web-rwkv-axum`

Here're docs that you can refer to for many sort of problems you might met while using `web-rwkv-axum`, making websocket clients to start use it, as well as trying to implement customized `sampler` or `logits transformer` for it.

It has two parts, `api` and `components`. If you read the docs just for the Websocket API specification, check out everything under `api`, or if you want to write some additional code to add new `sampling methods`, `penalties`, or even customized `logits transformation`, go to the `components` folder.
