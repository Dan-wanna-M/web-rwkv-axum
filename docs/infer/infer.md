## `infer`

TODO: add infer docs after rework.

If you have a need of it, you can refer to [here](/tests/curl_ws.py) to see how to construct a pipeline and make it run.

Note that this is not the final version due to some design flaw I found in the sampling process, will need to fix it after a rework of the entire framework.
