## Components

In `web-rwkv-axum`, there're 3 types of components: `Sampler`, `Transformer` and `Terminal`. Users can use them to construct a pipeline which will be suitable for their needs.

In this section, we will be talking about how to implement a component, trait specifications and some important notes that developers should notice when they're trying to implement their own components.

For each kind of component, please refer to the `Sampler.md`, `Transformer.md` and `Terminal.md` in this directory.
